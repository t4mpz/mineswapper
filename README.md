# Mineswapper Java
Simple tool to selecting and changing minecraft mods from forge snapshots versions without using that proprietary software of forge *(I don't know if it's really proprietary, but I don't need to download it on my machine just to change the mods versions, I don't even change them so much >~<)*

## Status
Again, main base working and everything, just need to make it's GUI and CLI.
* CLI because of the commands and stuff
* GUI because, java, that's why I'm using Java, I need to practice more ui with it

One might say "But you could have used python", for that the answer is: I don't trust python to manage my directories normally, imagine it managing my minecraft versions...what a mess.
